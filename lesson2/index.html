            <h2>White Space: <a href="https://amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h2>

            <li>This is a depiction of the white space and clean design principle. Amazon has white space and padding
                around all of their products. It segments the individual products properly and has a nice look to it.

            <img class="picture" src="images/greenmagichomes.png" alt="Screenshot of Green Magic Homes website">
            <li>This shows Hick's law pretty well. It only gives one option - Learn more. This minimizes the amount of
                time people have to think about what they want. If they are on their website, they probably want to
                learn more and that option is provided. Seen better on a larger display.</li>

            <img class="picture" src="images/wix.png" alt="Screenshot of Wix website">
            <li>This website shows proximity. Because the items are grouped together in an organized way, and they are
                close to one another, we consider them all part of one group. If they were spread out evenly, we
                wouldn't know where one stopped and the next started. Seen better on a larger display.</li>
