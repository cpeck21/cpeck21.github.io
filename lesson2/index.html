                <p>Amazon</p>
                <a href="https://amazon.com/">https://amazon.com/</a>

                <li>This is a depiction of the white space and clean design principle. Amazon has white space and
                    padding around all of their products. It segments the individual products properly and has a nice
                    look to
                    it.
                </li>

                <a href="https://greenmagichomes.com">https://greenmagichomes.com</a>

                <li>This website shows proximity. Because the items are grouped together in an organized way, and they
                    are close to one another, we consider them all part of one group. If they were spread out evenly, we
                    wouldn't know where one stopped and the next started. </li>

                <h2>&nbsp Hick's Law: </h2>
                <p>Wix</p>
                <a href="https://wix.com">https://wix.com</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img class="picture" src="images/wix.png" alt="Screenshot of Wix website">
                <li>This shows Hick's law pretty well. It only gives one option - Learn more. This minimizes the amount
                    of time people have to think about what they want. If they are on their website, they probably want
                    to
                    learn more and that option is provided. </li>
