        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience for this website will be for the person who is traveling to the new city. It is called
            Wright Weather named after the wright brothers and airplanes. (I was very pleased with how creative it was)
        </p>
        <h2>Persona 1</h2>
        <p>Jim is a 36 year-old father of 4 kids and is a hardworking business man. He is required to travel for work
            more often than he would like to. He does not like spending time away from his family, but knows that it is
            necessary in order to provide for them. One of the things that he likes least and his wife likes least is
            when he gets stuck in a far away land because of poor timing of his travel. If he had just flown home one
            day
            before, he would have avoided the storm and been able to be with his family. He needs a good weather source
            in order to
            be the family man he wants to be.
            <h2>Persona 2</h2>
            <p>Mary is a 64 year-old active woman. Her and her husband enjoy going out on hikes around the town where
                they can reminice about their life together. They are increasing in age and decreasing in ability to get
                around on the trails if the weather does not permit it. Each of them have a degree in orinthology so they know when the right
                birds will be out in order for them to watch them. They need an accurate weather source to let them know when they should
                go on their hikes so they will be able to plan ahead and catch that Stresemann's Bristlefront they have always wanted to see. </p>
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What day should I fly so that I have the least possibility of getting stuck in snow?</li>
                <li>When should we go hike the butte?</li>
                <li>Are the birds going to be out today, or is it to cold?</li>
                <li>When should I leave rexburg and go home so that I do not get caught in a blizzard?</li>
                <li>Should I ride my motorcycle to school today, or is it going to be to cold?</li>
            </ul>
